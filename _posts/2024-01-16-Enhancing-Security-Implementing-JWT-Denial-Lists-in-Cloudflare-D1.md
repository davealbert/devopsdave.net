description: In today's live stream, we focused on adding an extra layer of security to our JWT implementation. We accomplished this by adding used refresh tokens to a denial list in the Cloudflare D1 database, effectively blocking their reuse. We also discussed and potentially implemented measures to block access tokens, ensuring comprehensive security against token misuse in our serverless environment.

    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
        Join us on today's DevOps Dave stream as we elevate our application's security by adding used JWT refresh tokens to a denial list and blocking their reuse. We'll also explore the potential of blocking access tokens through a similar denial list mechanism, all integrated with the Cloudflare D1 database.

    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
        This session is critical for those looking to implement robust security measures in their applications. We'll demonstrate how to efficiently manage JWT tokens, preventing their misuse and enhancing the overall security posture of our serverless setup. Using Cloudflare's D1 database, we'll set up and manage these denial lists, ensuring that once tokens are used or compromised, they cannot be reused.
    </p>
    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
        Expect a detailed, hands-on approach as we navigate through the complexities of token management and security. This live stream is perfect for developers who want to deepen their understanding of JWTs and learn practical ways to secure their applications against token-related vulnerabilities.
