    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
       In today's stream on DevOps Dave, we're picking up where we left off in our exploration of the Hono framework within Cloudflare Workers. Join us as we delve deeper into the nuances of creating APIs using Hono and venture into the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication.
    </p>
    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
       We'll be coding live, experimenting with the Hono framework to build out our API, focusing on its integration and functionality in a serverless environment. The session aims to showcase the flexibility and power of Hono in handling API requests efficiently.
