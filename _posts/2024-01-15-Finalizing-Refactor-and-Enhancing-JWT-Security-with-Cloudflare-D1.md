    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
        Today on DevOps Dave, we're wrapping up our comprehensive refactor of models and routers, and taking a significant step forward in security by adding JWT refresh and deny lists to the Cloudflare D1 database. This session is pivotal as we fine-tune our application for better structure and enhanced security.
    </p>
    <p class="top-margin-blog-post">
        We'll be completing the model and router refactoring, ensuring our code is cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable. Following this, we'll focus on implementing JWT refresh tokens and deny lists, a crucial aspect for maintaining robust security in our application. Using the Cloudflare D1 database, we'll set up a system to handle token invalidation and management, ensuring a higher level of security for user sessions.
