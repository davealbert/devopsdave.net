        In today's live stream, we focus on enhancing our React application by implementing the refresh token functionality. We detailed the process of securely sending refresh tokens to our Cloudflare Worker API and handling the reception of new access tokens. This session offered practical insights into managing token lifecycles and maintaining secure user sessions in full-stack applications.Join today's DevOps Dave stream as we continue evolving our React application, specifically focusing on the crucial process of token refreshing. We'll dive into the mechanics of using refresh tokens to securely obtain new access tokens, ensuring uninterrupted user sessions and robust security in our full-stack setup.
